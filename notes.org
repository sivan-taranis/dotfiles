#+title: Notes
* Projects
** Scouting Notes
*** Design
1. threats & threats_cat in one nested answer, filter will be done in the backend accourding to the new column "is_scouting_notes"
   1. how to name the col?
*** Investigate
1. how long the generateed url link for an img will be valid? boken url issue
2. go over ScoutApp img flow (through the backend?)

*** with raz
- img id - the filename, client-side generated
- Add storage_id in geolocation, to add another storage to buckets, for each bucker(5)
- exploerer filesystem hirarchy? for CS
- urls are valid for 1 hour as default (maybe) and configurable

** Git Lecture
*** Why
- cuz team and stuff
*** The perfect commit
Commit Early And Often
1. Commit the right changes -
   1. Just like function, atomics ops
   2. Same context
   3. bad examples
      1. https://github.com/taranisag/service-notifications/pull/37#pullrequestreview-965738320
2. Add the right descrition alogside
   1. Short (if its hard, it might indicate that this is should be split to 2)
*** Branches ()
*** Git flows
1. github flow (us)
2. git flow (releases)
*** Conflics
* Todo
** Short term
1.

** Long term
- FunDay
- clean confluence
- git best practices lessons
- The PR for reducing logs
* Others
** Laptop tranfers
- latest settings .json
- keybinding.json
- .devcontainer
- org file(s)
** Backend meeting
- Remove old shit - old branches, dockerhub images, gemfury, jenkins?
- dotfiles in repos
- Django old and not supported version
* 1o1
- SQL learning
- Django course
- Hubspot emails - who is watching and responding?


* Trash
** User notes
*** Questions -
**** user-prop -
1. Import from firestore
2. Sync old base64 ids with new int ones
**** user-prop table -
1. Entity_id is hex and not int
2. In mavrx db or global? mavrx
**** Importing from firestore -
1. How to import?
2. ids are hex, in Pg-db its num, how to handle?
*** Presentation -
**** First goal - Match the existing state, no firebase
1. Create table for [user]notes
2. Import user-props to existing table
3. Show db table
**** Issues and open questions
1. Id - base64 to int issue
   - Solving by saving the mapping(64->id), updating the user-props FK, and forgetting about 64. Using a script to general SQL updates(?)
     - In between time PG\FS issue
   - After speaking with Eli, he suggested leaving it as it is, as this is prefered over inc-ints
2. Export import issue
   - There are some tools and scripts, im still researching.
   - Manual sql generator is the fastest but also a bit risky. To tuckle that Ill test on QA extensively.
   - Support utils - existing migration script
3. look on specification
*** After presentation -
**** no need to migrate user-props from FS, only update ids of notes
**** The issue with inishgt->notes relation or note->insight, what about img?
**** Design doc insights -
1. "Threats data that can be selected from drop-down fields"
   - So text+img+threat_with savirety for each note?
2. several notes for one insight

** Taranis Global Visit Notes
*** Smaller gap between CS and DEV
- How do we work more closely together to keep this conecteivity and conversetion?
- Webinar?
